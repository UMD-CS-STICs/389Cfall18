# Wallets

This week we went over different types cryptocurrency wallets, and the trade-offs between security and convenience. The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S8R3Vdf2mI1azvrqNgh6PIpntwJaPpjb1OczNKXPn2Y/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this directory, as per usual. Project 2 is out now in this directory. In this project, you will act as a node on Bitcoin's network that verifies transactions and updates the UTXO pool. We strongly recommend doing this in an IDE, as the project has a lot more overhead to run the tests this time around. We will have office hours as usual over the next two weeks to help anyone with the project. We advise getting an early start, as you may have questions regarding some of the instructions about inputs and outputs.
