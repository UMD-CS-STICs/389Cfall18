# Cryptocurrency Market and ICOs

This week we went over cryptocurrency markets and ICOs. You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_MVeM3Kf5ePAYY6m1Od1Eus-zRTKmGtLZE3Rr50bTY/edit?usp=sharing), as well as in this repo. The final project is now out and can be found in this folder. You have the rest of the semester to work on the project - its due date is December 7th). **We encourage you all to work in partners.** While you are free to work on the project on your own, it will help to have someone to work with to overcome the learning curve and come up with a novel idea for the project. Remember that before you get started on the project, you need to get approval from John and I first. You can email us with a description of your idea as well as how it satisfies the constraints outlined in the project README.md file.
