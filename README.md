## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department <a href="https://grades.cs.umd.edu/">grades server</a>.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 20% | Quizzes | We will regularly have quizzes in class based on readings from the previous week or in-class slides/lecture. |
| 30% | Codelabs | Codelabs will be centered around specific aspects of cryptocurrency technology that you will implement. |
| 20% | Midterm | The midterm will be in exam format on topics discussed during the first half of the semester. Questions will be mostly high-level and conceptual, rather than low-level. |
| 30% | Final Project | The final will project will be an original Ethereum Smart Contract. Students may draw inspiration from existing Ethereum Smart Contract applications, such as voting or gambling, but must implement the contract themselves. All students will present their contracts at the end of the semester. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted within one week of when it is returned. No requests
will be considered afterwards.

## Projects
The projects are meant to get you familiar with the low-level implementation of the technology that goes into cryptocurrency. Projects will focus on simplified implementations of core concepts, such as the blockchain, wallets and transactions, and contracts. Although most of the Bitcoin core is written in C++, the projects will mostly be implemented in Java for simplicity. The final project will be in Solidity, Ethereum's Smart Contract programming language.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: in-person during office hours and piazza. Email should
only be used for emergencies and not class related questions (e.g., homework).
