# Blockchain Structure

As mentioned in class this week, the first project is out and is due by 11:59:59 PM on 09/21. The project can be found in this folder. For the project, you will be building a simple block that would go on Bitcoin's blockchain by using a previous block hash, a list of transactions, and finding your own nonce. More details can be found in the README.md file in the project folder. If you have not already cloned this repo, I highly recommend doing that as soon as possible, as it makes it much easier to get necessary material for the class.
  
The slides from this week on blockchain structure can be found in this folder as well as [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pY8M0tsX3XhidKTRlnUyGd6FCARV6lcsyo-aSZ8o3ns/edit?usp=sharing). Next week we will be covering Proof-of-Work and Mining, which should help with the project if you are having any trouble getting started.
