# Intro to Cryptocurrency

Thanks to everyone for a great first day of class! As we mentioned in class, this course will mostly focus on the technical and economic aspects of bitcoin, but will also cover a few other coins towards the end of the semester.
  
The slides from today are in this folder as well as [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1My9HGRXohH8aEkJElJSaxQQxcFp6Jxa7vHHXyF3RLwY/edit?usp=sharing). This github repo is important because we will be posting our projects through here so make sure to bookmark/star it or follow this repo. If you haven't already, please fill out the feedback form mentioned on Piazza so we have a better idea of where the class stands on previous knowledge.

The homework for next class is to read bitcoins original whitepaper, which can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). If you don't understand all of it (especially the math), that is okay, just try to grab the basic concepts covered in the paper (there is also a great annotated version of the paper that can help with understanding that can be found [here](http://fermatslibrary.com/s/bitcoin)). The short quiz will not be on specific implementation details, but rather the high-level concepts covered.
